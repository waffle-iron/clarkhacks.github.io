### Bio:
Sheldon is a curious little critter that is very sociable. Most people love him from the start. I adopted him on __May 7th, 2016__. Every since that day he's been my best friend. His favorite food is grapes and he loves tea every once and awhile. Everyone in my family adores Sheldon and spoils him!

### Why the blog?
Well, I wanted something to do one day and here I am. My little buddy loves the attention and I love that so many people like him!

***

### Where is he from originally?
I got Sheldon in Missouri. He was near a park out there and right away we clicked! I found him out in the road laying down soaking up some sun. Right away he seemed interested in me. His first action was to bite the banana piece I offered.

***

### Does he have playmates?
Yes! He has lots! I plan showing them on the blog one day here soon.

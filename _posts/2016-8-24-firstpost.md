### This is my first blog post!
I am currently learning how to work around jekyll. It's pretty weird to me. I'm use to HTML5 as it is so I keep trying to do stuff like create a nav bar for each page, with jekyll I don't have to!  Jekyll is really growing on me. I keep learning new things and hope to use it a lot in the future. I haven't even began to learn how to make my own themes. There are a lot of nice templates so that makes getting started easy! I would recommend jekyll to almost anyone who enjoys blogging or just web development in general!

### Now a little about me!

If you wanna see more about me go to the ["about me"]({{ "/about" | prepend:site.baseurl }}) page!

So here it goes! I love my animals. I have lots and am always getting more! I always make sure all my animals are happy and healthy each morning, I even spoil one so much he has his own blog. Yup, you read correctly my turtle, Sheldon, has a blog. Feel free to check it out [here](https://sheldontheturtle.com). He's always happy to hear about new people enjoying his life!

As a person I would call myself a geek. I love web design and development. Anything to do with networking, computers, webpages, or circuitry I'm your guy!

### Turtle Picture Anyone?

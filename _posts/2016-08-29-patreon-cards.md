## Docs

##### Organization Name:

__The name you identify your account with.__

Ex: We have a Patreon for `Kittens`! These are `Brown` kitties. So we call out organization `Brown Kitties`

##### Create Slogan
__You know that part of your patreon where it says NAME is/are creating blah blah blah__

Great! Because that's under "Create Slogan" is where you put that!

##### Profile Image

__This can be ANY LINK to ANY IMAGE you want to go in the center circle!__

Tip: To use your Patreon photo right click on the image in the menu bar

![profile image](https://clarkhacks-labs.github.io/patreon-cards/assets/menuimage.jpg)

and click "copy image URL" paste that URL in the Profile Image section.

##### Fund ID
This one is a little tricky to find. So watch closely!
![instructions](https://clarkhacks-labs.github.io/patreon-cards/assets/fundid.gif)

 Incase you missed it:
 * goto your public profile.
 * click become a patron
 * copy the string of numbers after the &u=
 * you'll end up with &u=SOME NUMBER
 * all you need to paste is SOME NUMBER

This is used for the donated buttons and post buttons!

##### User ID
Your Patreon URL will look something like this `https://www.patreon.com/sheldontheturtle`

Your User ID is the part after .com/

So mine would be https://www.patreon.com/`sheldontheturtle`

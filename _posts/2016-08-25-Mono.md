### Mono_Vs._ Love
Wow. From a single kiss I've missed the entire second week of school... This sucks. My throat is covered in blister clusters by the hundreds. I hate it... Every time I breathe I almost (or do) cry. My coughs are full of blood and I have a headache like that of a God. 

### Was the kiss worth it? 
By far it was worth it. The sweat passion filled mystery that is a kiss is something I crave from her. I knew she was sick. I knew it was viral based on her lymph nodes. I still kissed her every chance I got. 

### Why though? 
Let me start off with this: `til' death do us part` is for the weak. She's my anything, my everything, the one that has done very same. Simply put: I didn't care I'd get sick. She's the one I'm closest too. The one for me. A few painful days (errr actually weeks) is worth being close to her üíù.
